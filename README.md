# My "Roguelike" Game

Yes, I agree it is not much of a game, much less a roguelike. However, that was my original idea when creating it. I made this sophmore year of college with very little python and general software development experience. I just thought it was cool so I put it here.

## Getting Started

Step zero (optional), create virtual python environment

```bash
$ python -3.7 -m venv env
$ env\scripts\activate
```

First, install required dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can launch the game by running:

```bash
$ python roguelikev3.py
```

## How to Play!

* Press "Play Game", then "Start" in the top left corner
* Move your character with WASD keys and shoot by clicking your mouse on the screen
* Destroy all the enemies to advance to the next level
* Inside of the wood blocks are some water, which you can collect if you want
* You can change your keybinds through the setting screen
* Have fun!
